Before running the code, ensure paths direct to the images above.

Various Keras Models were trained on images of skin lesions from the above dataset. 

The goal of the model building process was to detect the presence of melanoma from these images of skin lesions. 

The best results / neural network configuration can be found in the notebook "Best Results.ipynb".
